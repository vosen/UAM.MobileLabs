# Monodroid comics viewer
A simple comics viewer written using monodroid. Supports [.cbz/.zip](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comic_book_archive) files. Contains typical functions like zooming in/out, remembering last browsed path, last opened file and its zoom and position. Nothing extraordinary.
There's example comics bundled with the app.
